## Detection of Behavioural Disorders in Children

This project aims to develop a web application that utilizes machine learning to predict the potential for certain mental health disorders in children. The app targets parents or guardians as users, providing a platform to assess their child's behavior and receive insights.

## Disclaimer

It's crucial to emphasize that this app is not a substitute for professional diagnosis. It is intended to be a supportive tool to encourage parents to seek further evaluation if necessary.

## Key Features

- **Questionnaires**: Tailored questionnaires designed for parents to answer, addressing relevant symptoms and their duration.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Machine learning model integration to analyze user input and predict potential disorders. This should be presented as a probability or risk score, not a definitive diagnosis.
- **Educational Resources**: Provide access to credible resources on various child mental health topics, including information on symptoms, coping mechanisms, and professional help.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (consider frameworks like React or Vue.js if needed)
- **Backend**: Python (Django), Node.js (with Express.js)
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
